// Sum Lists: You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single
// digit. The digits are stored in forward order. Write a function that adds the two numbers and 
// returns the sum as a linked list.

// EXAMPLE
// lnput:(6 -> 1 -> 7) + (2 -> 9 -> 5).That is,617 + 295.
// Output: 9 -> 1 -> 2. That is, 912.
